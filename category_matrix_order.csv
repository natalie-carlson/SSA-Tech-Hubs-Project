Over the past 3 years, Kilimo Salama has successfully developed a weather micro- insurance distribution channel using a mobile phone registration platform in over 80 village agricultural input stores, reaching 50,000+ resource-poor farmers in six drought-prone areas of Kenya.

We take pride in the growing number of offices across Africa and the jobs that we provide to over a thousand people.    This group of companies have traded across Africa from Sudan to Mozambique and has also worked in Yemen. Civicon has subsequently gained a wealth of experience operating in the difficult conditions that occur in these countries, including both the physical problems typically encountered and also the bureaucratic ones, which can sometimes be more tedious.    The success of each project is based on our extensive experience and go-getting spirit, backed by our substantial resources. We have the practical knowledge required to make cost-effective planning and operational decisions. We have a highly skilled workforce that sees every obstacle as a challenge. Our comprehensive inventory of vehicles, machinery and tools gives us the means to get projects completed to the highest international standards.    Our speciality is the ability to formulate well designed and carefully thought out schemes; where alternate design concepts are explored, and integrated into the clients requirements. This ability to think outside the box and supply innovative solutions to complex problems is one of Civicon's specialities. This concept is well appreciated by many of our clients and this rapport developed between the client and Civicon means that clients tend to return again and again.

"147","ClinicMaster INTERNATIONAL","About us    Your clinic is dedicated to a single objective – to provide the best possible care for your patients. Yet the patient experience is very much defined by flow, transportation, environmental services, and other support areas that have a significant effect on patient flow including a patient leaving without being seen and general clinic management. A patient’s length of stay depends on effective patient’s tracking software and orchestration of their resource plan of care. Length of stay, in turn, has a direct bearing on capacity management and, ultimately, clinic costs and revenues. When one goes to a healthcare centre, usually a paper file is opened, data about a patient entered, and filed in cabin.    The process is repeated next time you go back for treatment. Despite the fact that this can go on for several years, it’s extremely difficult to make good use of data stored that way by clinician or researchers. A simple query such as number of female children seen in the last several years could take several days to get, moreover its accuracy may not be guaranteed. Consider a situation where by you visit one healthcare centre and next time go to another one if data is not stored electronically, there is no easy way of interlinking these centers to share patient’s history.    Through the use of hard copies of patient’s medical data, the same patient is given multiple identifiers at difference service access points, which makes it difficult to integrate these pieces of medical data for doctors say at different medical centre’s to share a particular patient’s medical history.    Managing healthcare centres manually makes it too complex to monitor the flow of drugs that leads to over and under stocking.

"177","Dazaar.com","Dazaar.com is an international e-commerce company with headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria. Founded in 2012, it is arguably one of Africa's the largest online retailer.    The company was incorporated by Roberts Utibe as Dazaar.com Limited in December 2013 although the site had already gone online in October 2012 as Dazaar.com™. The company's name was coined from the English word ""Dazzle""  and the Russian word ""tsar"" (pronounced: zär,(t)sär) which refers to the designate given to certain European Slavic monarchs or supreme rulers. The Dazaar Eagle Mascot was designed by Data Oruwari in 2013, and it represents the company's speedy shipments fulfilment of orders and an effective customer's service.    Dazaar.com started as an online grocery store but soon diversified into selling fashion, books, baby products, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys and jewelry.     Dazaar™  employs a multi-level e-commerce strategy. Dazaar™  started off by focusing on Business-to-Consumer relationships between itself and its customers, and Business-to-Business relationships between itself and its suppliers but it then moved to incorporate Customer-to-Business transactions as it realized the value of customer reviews as part of the product descriptions. It now also facilitates customer to customer with the provision of the Dazaar™  marketplace which act as an intermediary to facilitate consumer to consumer transactions. The company lets almost anyone sell almost anything using its platform. Dazaar™  provides an affiliate program that lets anybody post Dazaar™  links and earn a commission on click through sales.    Some other large e-commerce sellers use Dazaar™  to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Dazaar.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfilment.  Small sellers of used and new goods go to Dazaar™  Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price. Dazaar™  also employs the use of drop shippers or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Dazaar™  who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Dazaar™  increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years.

"203","East African Compliant Recycling","In emerging countries, the rapid economic growth has led to a rise in the generation of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste), coming both from local consumers and recycling of second-hand equipment imported for re-use. The European Environment Agency and United Nations Environment Programme estimate that 40-50 million tonnes of electrical equipment waste are produced each year globally. It’s increasing three times faster than all other types of domestic waste. ""Across Africa, the technology market is predicted to grow by over 8% a year for the next three years. This is great news for the region, but comes at a cost. E-waste in Africa is growing 20% each year due to rising sales of electronic goods and legal and illegal imports of second hand and surplus equipment"", explains  Dr. Kirstie McIntyre, Head of Environmental Compliance at HP.    For most of sub-Saharan African countries, the lack of a sustainable e-waste management infrastructure means that e-waste is collected and recycled in crude methods, causing the release of toxic chemicals to the environment and putting those refurbishing and dismantling e-waste at risk. This is aggravated by the fact these countries usually have little e-waste legislation and no regulations to protect the health of e-waste workers.    In October 2011, HP opened the East African Computer Recycling Company (EACR) in Mombasa, Kenya, in partnership with Camara Education, an ‘Education through ICT’ NGO working with disadvantaged communities in Africa (see EACR intro by Ken Mbwaya, former CEO of HP Kenya). Kenya generates thousands of tonnes of electronic waste per year – waste that on the one hand can cause great harm to the environment, but on the other, can be used as a resource and an economic stimulus. EACR is operating Kenya’s first e-waste recycling facility, operating to international health, safety and environmental standards and establishing a local, sustainable IT e-waste recycling industry. Until now, the facility received end-of-life IT from business and public sector customers, as well as from the informal sector, assessing the waste for refurbishment or recycling. EACR offers its workers advice on handling e-waste containing hazardous materials such as lead and cadmium.     Robert Truscott, CEO of Reclaimed Appliances (UK) Ltd, took over EACR in January 2012. EACR recently changed name (same acronym, but ‘computer’ changed to ‘compliant’) due to broadened scope of e-waste recycled from IT to ‘everything with a plug’ as well as non-electronic waste (all types of plastics).    If EACR has been able to prove on a small scale that its concept for e-waste recycling can work and that it changes the habits of local waste pickers in a sustainable manner (see the min' 46 in this recent documentary from the Swiss TV), our goal is now to create a financially viable business and therefore scale it up. EACR will soon be relocated in a bigger facility in Nairobi, which will source its e-waste  from collection centers working with the informal sector and located all over the Kenyan territory.     We firmly believe that e-waste management holds opportunities in skills transfer and revenue generation that can be turned into drivers for incorporating Africa’s informal recycling networks into economically, ethically and environmentally sustainable systems. Training the informal sector to proper collection, dismantling and recycling of e-waste is thus key for Kenya to ""capitalize on revenue opportunities whilst ensuring e-waste management can operate as a self-sustaining system"", as Dr. Kirstie McIntyre puts it.",0,552,0.571428571428571,0.50087032267781,24,0,"emerging countries rapid economic growth led rise generation electrical electronic waste waste coming local consumers recycling second hand equipment imported re use european environment agency united nations environment programme estimate million tonnes electrical equipment waste produced year globally increasing three times faster types domestic waste across technology market predicted grow year next three years great news region comes cost waste growing year due rising sales electronic goods legal illegal imports second hand surplus equipment explains dr kirstie mcintyre head environmental compliance hp sub saharan countries lack sustainable waste management infrastructure means waste collected recycled crude methods causing release toxic chemicals environment putting refurbishing dismantling waste risk aggravated fact countries usually little waste legislation regulations protect health waste workers october hp opened east computer recycling company eacr mombasa partnership camara education education ict ngo working disadvantaged communities see eacr intro ken mbwaya former ceo hp generates thousands tonnes electronic waste per year waste one hand cause great harm environment used resource economic stimulus eacr operating first waste recycling facility operating international health safety environmental standards establishing local sustainable waste recycling industry now facility received end life business public sector customers well informal sector assessing waste refurbishment recycling eacr offers workers advice handling waste containing hazardous materials lead cadmium robert truscott ceo reclaimed appliances uk ltd took eacr january eacr recently changed name acronym computer changed compliant due broadened scope waste recycled everything plug well non electronic waste types plastics eacr able prove small scale concept waste recycling work changes habits local waste pickers sustainable manner see min recent documentary swiss tv goal now create financially viable business therefore scale eacr soon relocated bigger facility nairobi source waste collection centers working informal sector located territory firmly believe waste management holds opportunities skills transfer revenue generation turned drivers incorporating informal recycling networks economically ethically environmentally sustainable systems training informal sector proper collection dismantling recycling waste thus key capitalize revenue opportunities whilst ensuring waste management operate self sustaining system dr kirstie mcintyre puts",FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Kenya",0,"",""

The Environmental Concerns & Orphanage Development Agency (ECODA) envisions active citizens, households, and organizations able to equitably and sustainably enjoy: Food Security; Income/Economic Security; Health Security; Education security; and good governance. These provide the central point for the empowerment of largely rural marginalized and vulnerable communities for sustainable livelihoods and selfreliance. Thus, the year 2010 witnessed a marked improvement in both the quantity and quality of our service delivery. In 15 districts of Uganda, ECODA was able to reach out to 500,000 people with different but innovative development programmes. By the end of the year, 83% of smallholder farming households in the project areas were able to eat three decent meals a day as a family; 75% had access to safe water; and 60% had and used own pit latrines. Income levels also improved as 9% of the households saved hard cash of at least UGX 1 million besides procuring a number of valuable assets – cows, bicycles, beds with mattresses, etc.",0,265,0.86046511627907,0.350604603563426,37,0,"environmental concerns orphanage development agency formed voluntary non profitable making non governmental organization registered ngo board november reg ecoda incorporated company limited guarantee september reg ecoda vision ensure sustainable use environment disseminating improved mechanisms provide orphaned children healthy caring loving environment ecoda mission ensure sustainability natural resources improve livelihoods needy people focus environmental protection efficient energy saving stoves solar energy biogas tree planting sustainable models conservation environmental concerns orphanage development agency ecoda envisions active citizens households organizations able equitably sustainably enjoy food security income economic security health security education security good governance provide central point empowerment largely rural marginalized vulnerable communities sustainable livelihoods selfreliance thus year witnessed marked improvement quantity quality service delivery districts ecoda able reach people different innovative development programmes end year smallholder farming households project areas able eat three decent meals day family access safe water used pit latrines income levels improved households saved hard cash least ugx million besides procuring number valuable assets cows bicycles beds mattresses etc",FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Uganda",0,"",""

"246","Feedbackplus","Feedbackplus.net, is a Web service which provides a platform for consumers to communicate constantly and continually with providers of products and services.     In this increasingly competitive world, organizations find they need to interact more and more with the users of their products and services. Accountability to the public is today an essential element of service provision. We are all human and make mistakes from time to time. This is not a problem as long as mistakes are realized, redressed and improvements are made for the future.     Research shows that nearly half of us will never make a complaint, mainly because we do not want the hassle or simply do not know how to go about it. This needs to change, not to turn us all into fault-finders but because organizations themselves welcome feedback.     Feedbacks are a gift, giving opportunity to improve products and services and to retain customer loyalty rather than lose them to competitors.    Feedbackplus.net is established to help customers give feedback and for organizations to also respond. Feedback procedures are often very difficult to track down and even when the procedures are found, they can seem very complicated and confusing. This portal aims to bring necessary information and channel under one umbrella, providing a one-stop platform for customers/consumers who want to give feedback.     We even make it easier for you by providing the platform to read other consumers views and feedback about organizations as well as the organizations' appreciation of customers pains/feedback; and by allowing you to communicate your complaints, concerns and issues to the relevant people where possible.     Feedbackplus.net is completely independent and does not represent any third party. We are here to provide a facility to benefit all and sundry.

"306","Graphic Communications Group","Graphic Communications Group Ltd (GCGL) was established in 1950 in the then Gold Coast by the Daily Mirror Group in the United Kingdom, with Cecil King Jnr as the first head of the company. Its original name was West African Graphic Company Limited. The company published its first newspaper, the Daily Graphic, On October 2, 1950, and followed it up in 1953 with the weekly Sunday Mirror, now called The Mirror.  The company later changed its name from West African Graphic Company Ltd to Ghana Graphic Company Ltd after the Gold Coast gained independence from Britain 1957 and changed its name to Ghana.    By an Act of Parliament the Government of Ghana acquired the company from its private owners in 1962. In 1971, the company became a statutory corporation through a legislative instrument – the Graphic Corporation Instrument, 1971, LI 709. This was in compliance with the Statutory Corporations Act, 1964 (Act 232). The company, therefore, became known as Graphic Corporation.     In response to market demands, the company added Graphic Sports in 1985 and Graphic Showbiz in 1998 to its publications. In 1999, the company took advantage of the Statutory Corporations (Conversion to Companies) Act, 1993, Act 461, to change from a corporation to an autonomous private limited liability company under the companies Code, 1963, Act 179. This resulted in autonomy for the company. Also, as part of the change, the company renamed itself the Graphic Communications Group Ltd and redefined its vision to become a multimedia organisation.     After becoming a limited liability, the company came up with four more publications: Junior Graphic (2000), Graphic Advertiser (2004), Graphic Nsempa (2007) and Graphic Business (2008). However, the company no longer publishes Graphic Advertiser and Graphic Nsempa.     Throughout this period, the company kept improving on its print quality by buying the state-of-the-art press of the time. It started in 1950 with the letterpress printing technology, which was the printing technology available at the time.     In 1976, the company installed the first web offset colour printing machine in Ghana. This was the semi-automatic Harris web offset press manufactured in the USA. The company bought two production lines. One was a four-unit press and the other a two-unit press. However, both could be set to work together if the company needed to print more pages at the same time.     Again, in 1995 Graphic led the newspaper industry in Ghana with an upgraded version of the web offset colour machine, the Heidelberg Harris press.  In 2011, the company again changed its printing machine with the installation of the KBA Comet press, which was (and it still is) the first of its kind in Ghana. Alongside the installation of this printing machine, the company also switched from the printing technology that required the use of films to one that requires no film, which is technically called computer-to-plate (CTP).    The Graphic Communications Group Ltd has one subsidiary company called the G-Pak, which is into commercial printing of books, packaging materials and other printing products (See G-PAK profile).",0,473,0.242424242424242,0.435194139889245,8,0,"graphic communications group ltd gcgl established gold coast daily mirror group united kingdom cecil king jnr first head company original name west graphic company limited company published first newspaper daily graphic october followed weekly sunday mirror now called mirror company later changed name west graphic company ltd graphic company ltd gold coast gained independence britain changed name act parliament government acquired company private owners company became statutory corporation legislative instrument graphic corporation instrument li compliance statutory corporations act act company therefore became known graphic corporation response market demands company added graphic sports graphic showbiz publications company took advantage statutory corporations conversion companies act act change corporation autonomous private limited liability company companies code act resulted autonomy company part change company renamed graphic communications group ltd redefined vision become multimedia organisation becoming limited liability company came four publications junior graphic graphic advertiser graphic nsempa graphic business however company longer publishes graphic advertiser graphic nsempa throughout period company kept improving print quality buying state art press time started letterpress printing technology printing technology available time company installed first web offset colour printing machine semi automatic harris web offset press manufactured usa company bought two production lines one four unit press two unit press however set work together company needed print pages time graphic led newspaper industry upgraded version web offset colour machine heidelberg harris press company changed printing machine installation kba comet press still first kind alongside installation printing machine company switched printing technology required use films one requires film technically called computer plate ctp graphic communications group ltd one subsidiary company called g pak commercial printing books packaging materials printing products see g pak profile",FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Ghana",0,"",""

For investors, multinationals, donors, and large organizations, they leverage their knowledge of African operations to create innovative structures and strategies, manage existing portfolios, analyse value chain opportunities, perform in-depth market assessments, and help answer difficult strategic questions, with their focus on actionable, tangible recommendations.    As they move into their fifth year of operations, they have completed more than 100 client engagements across 9 East and Southern African countries. They have a wide investor network that includes nearly 120 private equity funds, family offices, angel investors, and institutions headquartered in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America.

Proprietors of the organisation believe that of all the institutions of a modern democracy, the media matter in large measure. It can help forge new communities, pursue political and social agenda in support of a better society, and help build visions of hope and resistance. Sadly the media can also lead in negative directions: dividing people and truncating hope and vision. In their country, the media have played both roles at different times in their history.    Premium Times, founded in mid 2011, believes that the time has come for Nigeria to embrace the challenge of progress and development in a substantial, concrete sense. They bring a huge commitment to offer their country the type of media that will advocate for the people and nudge their nation on the path of development and social reengineering.    They are of the view that in terms of its formalistic processes, and its philosophy of content, the new media that will help spur the challenge of educational revolution, cultural rebirth, and economic development, in Nigeria, must be reflective, thoughtful, analytic and empathetic without a sense of entitlement and insularity. They have come to fill that lacuna in their press, and therefore raise the bar of journalism in their country.

Ideas for a solar toilet were tossed around, and prototypes were built in Bolivia in 2007 and 2008. Work continued through GTRI and Engineers Without Boarders on various iterations of the prototypes.

"655","SliceBiz","SliceBiz provides an easy-to-use web-based investment platform that can be used by anyone to make ‘micro investment’ transactions. Users create an ‘angel investor’ account linked to their mobile money accounts, bank accounts or credit cards. SliceBiz ensures maximum security and protects both parties against fraudulent transactions. For startups, this means they can get access to a whole new funding source which aggregates small investments from a large pool of “accredited” investors.    We’ve developed a hybrid approach. SliceBiz is using accredited investors in Angel networks to validate companies by allowing angels to first provide part of the startups funding before turning to the larger middle class group to ask for smaller investments.

"688","Strathmore University","Strathmore University, a leading University in the region, whose mission is to provide all-round quality education in an atmosphere of freedom and responsibility; excellence in teaching, research and scholarship; ethical and social development; and service to society.     Strathmore University is a leading not for profit private University operating in Kenya, which aims at serving the Kenyan society to the best of its ability. Specialising in Commerce and Information Technology, Strathmore holds a peerless reputation for quality in both academic and professional education and personal information.     Strathmore College was started in 1961 as an Advanced-level Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects by a group of professionals, who formed a charitable Educational Trust (now the Strathmore Educational Trust). Saint Josemaría Escrivá, founder of Opus Dei, inspired and encouraged them to start the College.     In March 1966, the first intake of Accountancy students, twenty-five in number, joined the Sixth Form students, and began preparing for the examinations of the UK-based Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). These first Accountancy students were sponsored by Shell East Africa, BAT (East Africa) and the East African Breweries. At this time Strathmore College was unique as a fully integrated post-Form 4 institution offering both academic and professional courses.     In October 1982, owing to the increased demand from companies for the professional training of their employees, the College began evening courses in Accountancy after normal working hours, with 60 students sponsored by various companies.     In 1986, in response to a request by the Trustees, the Government of Kenya donated 5 acres of land on Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate. The European Union (EU) and the Italian Government agreed to back the Madaraka Campus project. The donors were keen to support a co-educational College that would offer courses in Management and Accountancy. Kianda College, an undertaking of Kianda Foundation, which was planning new developments at the time, agreed to run their professional courses in the new Madaraka campus.     Construction of the new campus commenced in September 1989.

"770","Twiga Fruits","Twiga Fruits is committed to working with farmers to grow delicious fruit for people to enjoy. Their philosophy is that consumers appreciate knowing that the high quality fruits on their table come from a supply chain that fairly treats farmers and it’s their job to provide that bridge.    Twiga Fruits is a progressive leader in Kenya’s fruit industry. With a conviction that domestic fruit sales and foreign exports should serve as a backbone of Kenya’s economy, Twiga Fruits is built around a team of reformers with over 80 collective years of agronomic and supply chain experience.    In Kenya’s growing urban dwellings, Twiga Fruits is lowering prices by building distribution networks that beat the costly informal networks of layers of middlemen and brokers. When they say “Better Produce, Better Prices,” they mean it. There is no reason Kenyan fruit should cost as much in Nairobi as Dubai.    For export markets, Twiga Fruits is raising standards through being the market leader in digitized traceability of products.    Twiga Fruits treats all their farmers for what they are: professionals. As a company policy, Twiga Fruits differentiates itself by refusing to work with third-party “brokers”: traders who dominate the Kenyan fruit trade, profiting on farmers’ limited access to markets by buying at exploitatively prices, paying weeks later, and selling on to the local markets and exporters.     Twiga Fruits instead buys directly from the farmer, and they believe a farmer deserves to get paid immediately for any produce he sells. They make sure their farmers receive the technical support to increase production levels, meet global quality standards, and seek credit to expand their operations.

As a University poised to distinguish itself in the area of research to make an impact at the national and international level, the University has launched a new Strategic Plan. This new strategic plan (2014-2024) is intended to consolidate the gains made from the review of the University’s mission and practices and situate these within the context of a very dynamic environment of higher education in Ghana and beyond.     In addition, the University has several research institutions and centres for learning and research, including Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIR), Centre for Tropical, Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Regional Institute for Population Studies, Institute for Environmental and Sanitation Studies and the Institute for Statistical, Social and Economic Research.     As part of its vision to become a world class research intensive institution, University of Ghana has identified four priority areas where the university will focus and promote international collaboration in research initiatives to enhance the University’s research output.     As the leading university in Ghana, the University aims to produce the next generation of thought leaders to drive national development. Through our research institutes and other centres of learning and research, faculty members are involved in studies that support policy making for national development, often in collaboration with other international institutions.     There are currently a number of Ghanaian and international institutions that hold affiliation with the University of Ghana. As a leader in tertiary education, the University has established several link agreements with universities in Africa, Europe and North America for student, faculty and staff exchange as well as collaborative research.
